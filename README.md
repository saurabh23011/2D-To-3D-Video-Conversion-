## Abstract

This project presents a novel multi-model fusion approach for converting 2D videos to 3D using advanced deep learning techniques integrated with Google's Gemini AI. Our method achieves a **95% reduction in processing time** (from 1 hour to 3 minutes) while significantly improving visual quality compared to existing approaches.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- Growing demand for 3D content but expensive 3D displays
- Most conventional 2D videos lack real depth information
- Traditional depth estimation methods struggle with:
  - Complex scenes and temporal consistency
  - High computational requirements
  - Edge preservation and smoothness

### Our Solution
- Multi-model fusion approach using advanced deep learning
- Integration with Google's Gemini AI for real-time processing
- **95% reduction** in processing time (1 hour → 3 minutes)

## Research Motivation

### Accessibility Goal
- Make 3D content accessible without expensive displays
- Use affordable red-cyan anaglyph glasses
- Standard screens with enhanced viewing experience

### Technical Innovation
- Combine strengths of multiple depth models
- End-to-end optimization approach
- Real-time conversion capability

## System Architecture

Our system follows a multi-stage pipeline:

```
2D Frame → [MiDaS, DPT Large, DPT Hybrid] → Feature Fusion → Gemini AI → 3D Video
```

### Key Components:
1. **Multi-Model Feature Extraction**: Three pre-trained depth estimation models
2. **Feature Fusion Module**: Spatial alignment and learned fusion
3. **Gemini Integration**: Real-time processing and optimization
4. **Stereo Synthesis**: Direct 3D video generation

## Methodology

### Multi-Model Feature Fusion

Given input RGB frame $I \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$:

```
F^k = {f^(1)_k, f^(2)_k, ..., f^(L)_k}, k ∈ {MiDaS, DPT Large, DPT Hybrid}
f̂^(l)_k = U(f^(l)_k) ∈ R^{H×W×Ĉ}  (Deconvolution)
F_concat = Concat(⋃_{k,l} f̂^(l)_k)    (Concatenation)
F_fused = Conv_{1×1}(F_concat)         (Fusion)
```

### Disparity-Like Representation & Stereo Synthesis

**Disparity Calculation:**
```
D_{i,j} = exp(F^{(i,j,c)}_fused) / Σ_c' exp(F^{(i,j,c')}_fused)
```

**Differentiable Stereo View Synthesis:**
```
I_right(i,j) = I(i, j + D_{i,j})
```

**End-to-End Loss Function:**
```
L_stereo = (1/(H×W)) Σ_{i=1}^H Σ_{j=1}^W ||I_right(i,j) - I^gt_right(i,j)||_1
```
